I swear to f*cking god, dependencies took so long because of the Python version I used.
If anyone f*cks it up in PR's, i WILL find you.

PYTHON 3.11 IS RECOMMENDED FOR THESE SCRIPTS
WHEN INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES, RUN `pip cahce remove numpy`, `pip install numpy` and `pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps`

pip cache remove numpy
pip install numpy
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps
